# 2D Transient Conduction Simulation
This is the code for a 2D transient conduction simulation in python using finite difference. Capabilities include
- Temperature dependant thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat which can come from an equation or table.
- Time and space dependant convection, heat flux, and temperature boundary conditions.
- Time and space depndant energy generation.

## Example - Constant temperature boundary conditions.


## Example - Time and space dependant temperature boundary conditions.
